## üèóÔ∏è Category 1: Foundational Techniques

These are the most basic, yet essential, techniques for interacting with LLMs. They form the building blocks for more complex prompting strategies.

### 1. üéØ Zero-Shot Prompting

**Description:** Asking the model to perform a task without providing any examples. It relies solely on the model's pre-trained knowledge.

**When to Use:** For common, straightforward tasks where the model likely has a good understanding, or when you don't have good examples.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Translate the following English sentence to Spanish:
"Hello, how are you?"
```

### 2. üìö Few-Shot Prompting (In-Context Learning)

**Description:** Providing the model with one (one-shot) or several (few-shot) examples within the prompt itself to demonstrate the desired input/output format or behavior. This helps the model infer patterns.

**When to Use:** When the task is less common, requires a specific output format, or needs to adhere to a particular style. It's great for teaching the model "how" to respond.

**Example Prompt (Few-Shot):**
```
Classify the sentiment of the following movie reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral:

Review: "This movie was absolutely brilliant and captivating."
Sentiment: Positive

Review: "The plot was confusing, and the acting was subpar."
Sentiment: Negative

Review: "It was an okay film, nothing groundbreaking, but not terrible."
Sentiment: Neutral

Review: "I laughed so hard my stomach hurt! A must-watch."
Sentiment:
```

### 3. üìã Clear Instructions & Task Framing

**Description:** Directly and unambiguously stating the task, desired output format, and any constraints. Often combined with other techniques. This is arguably the most fundamental aspect.

**When to Use:** Always! Good prompt engineering starts with clear instructions.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Summarize the provided text in exactly 100 words. The summary should focus on the main arguments and be written in a neutral, objective tone.

[Text to summarize goes here]
```

---

## üéõÔ∏è Category 2: Context & Constraint-Based Techniques

These techniques provide the AI with necessary background information and set boundaries for its responses, ensuring relevance and adherence to rules.

### 1. ‚öôÔ∏è System Prompting

**Description:** (Often used in chat interfaces like Claude or ChatGPT) Setting an overarching behavior, persona, or set of rules for the AI that persists across multiple turns in a conversation. This acts as a global directive.

**When to Use:** To establish a consistent role or policy for the AI throughout a discussion.

**Example Prompt (System Prompt):**
```
You are a helpful programming assistant. Your goal is to provide concise, correct, and well-commented Python code snippets. Always explain your code. If a user asks for anything unethical or harmful, politely decline.
```
*(Note: In many systems, this is a separate field from the user prompt.)*

### 2. üé≠ Role Prompting

**Description:** Assigning a specific persona or role to the model for a particular interaction, which influences its tone, style, and knowledge base.

**When to Use:** To get responses from a specific perspective (e.g., expert, casual friend, historical figure).

**Example Prompt:**
```
Act as a seasoned cybersecurity analyst. Explain the importance of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in simple terms to a non-technical small business owner.
```

### 3. üß† Contextual Prompting

**Description:** Including specific background information, relevant facts, or previous conversation turns directly within the prompt to provide necessary context.

**When to Use:** When the AI needs specific data points or awareness of prior interactions to generate an accurate or relevant response.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Given the following product description:
"The XYZ Smartwatch features a 1.5-inch AMOLED display, 2-day battery life, heart rate monitor, and GPS. It's water-resistant up to 50 meters."

Write three unique selling propositions (USPs) for marketing this product.
```

### 4. üìù Markdown Prompting

**Description:** Using Markdown syntax (e.g., headings, bullet points, code blocks) within the prompt to explicitly define the desired structure and format of the output.

**When to Use:** When you need highly structured outputs (e.g., JSON, YAML, bulleted lists, tables, code).

**Example Prompt:**
```
Create a recipe for chocolate chip cookies.
Use the following markdown structure for your response:

# [Recipe Name]
## Ingredients
* [Ingredient 1]
* [Ingredient 2]
...
## Instructions
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...
```

---

## üß© Category 3: Reasoning & Planning Techniques

These methods are designed to guide the AI's internal thought processes, encouraging it to break down problems, plan steps, and show its work.

### 1. üîó Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

**Description:** Instructing the model to show its step-by-step reasoning process before arriving at a final answer. This dramatically improves performance on complex reasoning tasks (e.g., math word problems, logical puzzles) by encouraging intermediate thinking steps.

**When to Use:** For problems that require logical deduction, multiple steps, or problem-solving. It makes the model's "thinking" transparent.

**Example Prompt:**
```
The average speed of a car is 60 miles per hour. If it travels for 3.5 hours, how far does it travel? Show your work step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify given information.
Step 2: Identify what needs to be calculated.
Step 3: Recall the relevant formula.
Step 4: Perform the calculation.
```

### 2. üìä Tabular Chain-of-Thought (TCoT)

**Description:** A specific form of CoT where the reasoning steps are presented in a table format, often to enhance clarity and organization, especially for structured data or comparisons.

**When to Use:** When the reasoning involves multiple variables, comparisons, or a need for highly organized output.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Analyze the pros and cons of cloud computing vs. on-premise servers for a small startup. Present your analysis in a table with columns for 'Aspect', 'Cloud Computing (Pro/Con)', and 'On-Premise Servers (Pro/Con)'.

Thought Process Table:
| Aspect           | Cloud Computing (Pro/Con) | On-Premise Servers (Pro/Con) |
|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Initial Cost     |                           |                              |
| Scalability      |                           |                              |
| Maintenance      |                           |                              |
| Security         |                           |                              |
```

### 3. ü¶¥ Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT)

**Description:** Guiding the model to first generate a high-level outline or "skeleton" of the response, and then filling in the details for each section. This ensures comprehensive coverage and logical flow.

**When to Use:** For generating long-form content, essays, articles, or complex reports where structure is paramount.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Generate a comprehensive guide on starting a small online business. First, provide an outline of the main sections, then expand on each section with detailed information.

Outline:
1. [Section 1 Title]
2. [Section 2 Title]
3. [Section 3 Title]
...

Now, expand on each section:
```

### 5. üìã Generated Knowledge Prompting

**Description:** A technique where the model first generates relevant background knowledge or context before tackling the main task. This helps improve performance on knowledge-intensive tasks by providing the model with additional relevant information.

**When to Use:** For tasks requiring domain knowledge, fact-based reasoning, or when the model might benefit from additional context before responding.

**Example Prompt:**
```
First, generate some relevant knowledge about renewable energy storage technologies and their current limitations.

Based on that knowledge, now analyze: What are the three most promising solutions for grid-scale energy storage, and what are the main barriers to their widespread adoption?
```

---

## üéÆ Category 4: Advanced Orchestration & Control

These techniques are designed to manage complex interactions, ensure consistency, or guide the model through highly structured, multi-stage processes.

### 1. üéØ Self-Consistency

**Description:** This technique involves prompting the model multiple times for the same question, potentially with slightly varied prompts or by sampling different reasoning paths (e.g., using Chain-of-Thought). Then, the most consistent or frequently occurring answer among the generated responses is chosen as the final answer. It's like asking several experts and taking the consensus.

**When to Use:** For critical tasks where accuracy is paramount, especially in reasoning, mathematical problems, or logical puzzles, where a single incorrect step can derail the entire solution.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Solve the following riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?"
Think step-by-step to arrive at the answer.
```
*(You would run this prompt several times, compare the 'Thought' processes and final answers, and pick the most frequent correct one.)*

### 2. üìà Least-to-Most Prompting

**Description:** Breaking down a complex problem into a sequence of simpler sub-problems. The solution to each sub-problem is then used as context or input for solving the next, building up to the final answer. This is akin to scaffolding a solution.

**When to Use:** For highly complex problems that are naturally decomposable, where solving intermediate steps is necessary to progress. It reduces cognitive load on the model.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Task: Write a Python script to fetch the current weather for a given city and display the temperature and humidity.

Step 1: First, write the Python code to make an API request to a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) using a placeholder API key and city name.
Step 2: Next, parse the JSON response from the weather API to extract the temperature and humidity.
Step 3: Finally, combine these parts into a full script and add print statements to display the results clearly.
```

### 3. üîÑ Self-Generated In-Context Learning

**Description:** The model is first prompted to generate its *own* relevant examples or demonstrations based on a general task description. Then, these self-generated examples are used as few-shot examples in a subsequent prompt to help the model solve a new, similar problem.

**When to Use:** When you want the model to learn from "itself" for a specific task without manually crafting examples, or when the task is unique and no existing examples are readily available.

**Example Prompt (Two-stage process):**

*Stage 1 Prompt:*
```
Generate 3 examples of how to rephrase a formal sentence into a casual one.
Example 1:
Formal: "Kindly provide the documentation at your earliest convenience."
Casual: "Can you send the docs when you get a chance?"
Example 2:
Formal:
Casual:
...
```

*Stage 2 Prompt (after getting examples from Stage 1):*
```
[Include the 3 examples generated in Stage 1 here]

Now, rephrase the following formal sentence into a casual one:
Formal: "I respectfully request an update on the project's progress."
Casual:
```

### 4. üå≥ Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)

**Description:** An advanced reasoning technique that explores multiple reasoning paths (like branches of a tree) and allows the model to backtrack or prune less promising paths. It involves generating multiple intermediate "thoughts" or possible next steps, evaluating them, and then pursuing the most promising ones.

**When to Use:** For highly complex problems that require strategic search, planning, or decision-making, where there isn't a single obvious step-by-step solution. It's more sophisticated than simple CoT.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Problem: You are given 5 items with weights and values: (A: 2kg, $10), (B: 3kg, $15), (C: 1kg, $7), (D: 4kg, $20), (E: 2kg, $12). Your backpack can hold a maximum of 6kg. Which items should you choose to maximize total value?

Explore multiple thought paths. For each path, consider:
1. Initial choice.
2. Remaining capacity.
3. Next best item to add.
4. Total value and weight.

Evaluate each path and determine the optimal selection.
```

### 5. ü§ù Interactive Tree-of-Thoughts (iToT)

**Description:** An extension of ToT where a human intervenes at various points in the "thought tree" to provide feedback, steer the model, or prune incorrect branches. This combines the structured reasoning of ToT with human guidance.

**When to Use:** For extremely challenging problems where human intuition or domain expertise is needed to guide the AI's exploration, making it a powerful human-AI collaboration tool.

**Example Interaction:**
```
AI: "I'm considering two paths for the marketing campaign: Path A (social media focus) and Path B (email campaign focus). What are your initial thoughts on these approaches?"

User: "Path A sounds good, but ensure it targets Gen Z. Let's explore that branch."

AI: "Focusing on Path A. My next thoughts are to identify key social platforms. Should I prioritize TikTok or Instagram?"

User: "Go with TikTok for this product."
```
*(This back-and-forth guides the AI's internal ToT process.)*

### 6. ü§ñ ReAct (Reason + Act)

**Description:** A framework that combines reasoning and acting in an interleaved manner. The model alternates between thinking about the problem, taking actions (like using tools or gathering information), and reasoning about the results to determine next steps.

**When to Use:** For complex problem-solving that requires multiple steps, tool usage, research, or when the solution path isn't clear from the start. Particularly effective for AI agents and interactive workflows.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Solve this step by step using reasoning and actions:

Task: Find the best restaurant in downtown Seattle for a business dinner tonight.

Think: What information do I need to find the best restaurant?
Act: Search for highly-rated business restaurants in downtown Seattle
Observe: [Results from search]
Think: Now I need to check availability and make recommendations
Act: Check availability for tonight at top 3 options
Observe: [Availability results]
Think: Based on ratings, availability, and business dinner suitability...
Act: Provide final recommendation with reasoning
```

### 7. üìö Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Description:** A technique that combines the model's pre-trained knowledge with real-time retrieval of relevant information from external knowledge bases, documents, or databases. This enhances accuracy and provides up-to-date information.

**When to Use:** When you need current information, domain-specific knowledge, or factual accuracy that goes beyond the model's training data. Essential for enterprise applications requiring access to proprietary data.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Using the retrieved documents about our company's Q4 financial performance:

[Retrieved Context: Q4 revenue increased 15%, costs rose 8%, new product line launched...]

Based on this specific financial data, analyze our company's performance and recommend strategic priorities for Q1. Cite specific numbers from the retrieved information.
```

---

## üé® Category 5: Style, Tone & Persona

These techniques are about controlling the aesthetic and emotional qualities of the AI's response, making it suitable for specific audiences or situations.

### 1. üé® Emotional & Style Prompting

**Description:** Explicitly instructing the model on the desired emotional tone (e.g., empathetic, excited, neutral, urgent) and overall writing style (e.g., formal, casual, academic, poetic).

**When to Use:** When the manner in which the information is conveyed is as important as the information itself, such as in marketing copy, creative writing, customer service responses, or internal communications.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Rewrite the following technical explanation of blockchain technology in a way that is inspiring and easy for a high school student to understand, emphasizing its potential for a fairer future.
[Technical explanation text]
```

### 2. üí° Creative Incentive Prompting

**Description:** Adding phrases that imply high stakes or reward for producing a high-quality output. While seemingly psychological, these can sometimes nudge models to dedicate more "effort" or focus. It encourages the model to think it's solving a very important problem.

**When to Use:** When you need the absolute best effort from the model on a critical task, although its effectiveness can vary between models and iterations.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Generate a compelling marketing slogan for a new eco-friendly cleaning product. This is extremely important for our launch, and the success of our company depends on a truly impactful slogan.
```

---

## üîß Category 6: Iterative Improvement & Refinement

These techniques involve guiding the AI through a process of self-correction or external feedback to refine and enhance its outputs over multiple interactions.

### 1. üîÑ Rephrase & Respond / System 2 Attention

**Description:** Instructing the model to first rephrase or critically analyze the input prompt to ensure it fully understands the query, *before* generating its final response. This helps prevent misunderstandings and encourages deeper processing.

**When to Use:** For complex, ambiguous, or critical questions where a precise understanding of the query is vital for an accurate response. It simulates a "System 2" (slow, deliberate) thinking process.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Before answering, rephrase the user's request in your own words to confirm understanding. Then, provide a detailed response.

User Request: "How do I optimize my website for search engines without spending too much money?"

Rephrased Request: [Model's rephrasing here]
Detailed Answer: [Model's answer here]
```

### 2. üîß Recursive Criticism & Improvement (RCI)

**Description:** Prompting the model to generate an output, then critically evaluate its *own* output for flaws or areas of improvement, and finally revise the output based on its self-criticism. This can be done iteratively.

**When to Use:** For tasks requiring high quality, precision, or adherence to specific criteria, allowing the model to refine its own work. It mimics a self-review process.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Write a short persuasive paragraph arguing for remote work.
After writing the paragraph, critically analyze it. Identify any weaknesses, logical gaps, or areas for stronger persuasion.
Finally, rewrite the paragraph based on your self-criticism to improve its effectiveness.
```

### 3. üß© Decomposed Prompting

**Description:** Explicitly breaking down a complex problem into distinct, smaller sub-tasks, and then guiding the model to address each sub-task sequentially. This is similar to Least-to-Most, but emphasizes the *explicit definition* of sub-tasks by the prompt.

**When to Use:** For highly structured problems that can be naturally divided, ensuring that each component is addressed thoroughly before combining for the final solution.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Task: Create a marketing email for a new online course on Python for Data Science.

Sub-task 1: Write an engaging subject line that highlights the benefit of the course.
Sub-task 2: Draft the opening paragraph, addressing a pain point for beginners in data science.
Sub-task 3: List 3-4 key benefits or modules of the course using bullet points.
Sub-task 4: Write a clear call-to-action to enroll in the course.
Sub-task 5: Combine all parts into a complete email.
```

### 4. ‚ùì Self-Ask Prompting

**Description:** Instructing the model to ask itself follow-up questions relevant to the initial query, and then using the answers to those self-generated questions to inform its final response. It's a way for the model to gather more information or clarify its understanding internally.

**When to Use:** For open-ended questions or tasks where the initial prompt might lack sufficient detail, prompting the model to explore relevant sub-topics.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Answer the following question thoroughly: "How does climate change impact global food security?"

First, ask yourself relevant sub-questions that need to be answered to address the main question comprehensively. Then, answer each of those sub-questions, and finally, synthesize your answers into a complete response to the original question.
```

---

## üî¨ Category 7: Specialized & Advanced Techniques

### 1. ‚öñÔ∏è Constitutional AI (CAI)

**Description:** Training the model to critique and revise its own outputs based on a set of principles or "constitution." This helps ensure responses align with desired values and guidelines.

**When to Use:** For sensitive topics or when you need responses that adhere to specific ethical guidelines or organizational policies.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Generate a response to this customer complaint about a delayed order. Before finalizing your response, review it against these principles:
1. Show empathy and understanding
2. Take responsibility without making excuses
3. Offer concrete solutions
4. Maintain a professional tone

Revise your response if needed to better align with these principles.
```

### 2. üëÅÔ∏è Perspective-Taking Prompting

**Description:** Explicitly asking the model to consider multiple viewpoints or stakeholder perspectives before providing a response.

**When to Use:** For complex decisions, controversial topics, or when you need a balanced analysis that considers various stakeholders.

**Example Prompt:**
